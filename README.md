**PROJECT GOALS**

The goal of this project is to create a Full Stack web application to utterly demonstrate the knowledge and skillset obtained throughout the course. A passing grade in this project is required to graduate the course and obtain the Certification Degree. The site is using Python and Django Framework with a back-end database (PostgreSQL) for the back-end stack. HTML5, CSS3 with Bootstrap 4.5 as framework and jQuery are being used on the front-end stack.

**Wireframes**


## Demo


## Layout

**Color Scheme**

Color scheme is important as this is one of the first things site visitors notice when visiting the site. I chose white / black for the site's primary colors because these colors match the secondary earthy colors and make the website look professional and high-end. In addition to that, for the secondary colors of the site, I wanted to create a natural / delicate atmosphere to represent the calming sensation of flowers. For the secondary colors, I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to create a color pallet, which you can find below.


## Features

**Existing Features**

This website is composed of 6 applications: `home`, `blog`, `cart`, `checkout`, `products`, `profiles`.

The structure of the site is described in the section below:

**Home Page - serves as the initial landing page for all users**


## Features Left to Implement

There are some of features left to implement in the future which I could not add to the project this time due to time constraints. These features are great to be added for a more complete online shop service which would lead to higher customer satisfaction.

**Admin: defensive modal**

A 'must' have necessity to prevent edit/delete a product by mistake.
